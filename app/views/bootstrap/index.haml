%p= "#{link_to 'Bootstrap', 'http://getbootstrap.com/', target: '_blank'} is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only."

%p= "Almost everything you see in the application is styled by Bootstrap 3: The navigation bar at the top, the tables, the forms, the buttons etc. #{link_to "This Bootstrap theme", "https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/", target: '_blank'} was adapted slightly to what I felt looked nicest. The original theme had the navigation bar on the left hand side of the screen, but when I loaded the theme it was on the top. I don't really know why, but I was going to try and put it on the top anyway, so I just left it."
